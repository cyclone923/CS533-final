This is a fine project. However, given the time constraints and computational constraints 
I suggest that you focus on a single Atari game. Perhaps you can include more games if you 
finish results for one game, but time is limited. I would prefer to see a more in depth 
investigation on a single game than more domains with less insight. 

Note that the grade will depend on the degree that you explore choices in the algorithm(s).
You are going to be limited in compute time, so you will want to pick a few options vary 
and explore, but not too many.
